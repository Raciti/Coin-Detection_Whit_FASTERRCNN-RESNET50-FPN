## Tecnologies
<p>The following two technologies were mainly used for the implementation of the project:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b> Segment Anything Model (Sam) </b> is a promptable segmentation system with zero-shot generalization to unfamiliar objects and images, without the need for additional training.
      <p align="center">

      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      The <b> Faster R-CNN </b>(Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) is an algorithm for object detection in images. It is one of the most popular and effective convolutional neural networks for the task of object detection.
      Faster R-CNN is known for its accuracy and speed compared to previous approaches such as R-CNN and Fast R-CNN. It introduces the concept of region proposal generation via RPN, which makes the entire object detection process more efficient and accurate.
